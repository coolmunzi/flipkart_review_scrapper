iphone,Flipkart Customer,4,Worth the money,As always compact and handy ... with good image stability 4K gives amazing experience Battery capacity is little poor .. it‚Äôs worth buying on this budget..4/5 my rating
iphone,Vishnuvardhan Meda,4,Wonderful,Mobile is very handy. Packed with good performances and nice camera. This is my first iPhone. Very good experience with Apple. Battery is worst. I am hardly getting 5 hours screen on time.  Positive thing is I came to know how many hours I was spending on my mobile. Because of poor battery now I am only using mobile for 4 hours a day.
iphone,Saurabh N,4,Nice product,Let's face it. The main reason you're even considering this is because you want a compact phone that doesn't compromise on power. Getting OS updates for another 4-5 years: with a decent camera: waterproofing and wireless charging is just an added advantage. There's a few things it could've done better: 1. Battery is barely adequate for a day of moderate usage.2. The bezels could have been reduced to have more screen to body ratio.3. Night mode for the camera was a software feature that ...

iphone,Prashant Kumar Sharma,1,Unsatisfactory,Everything is fine of this mobile except battery. Battery consumption at 8-10% Brightness inVideo call : almost 4% reduction for every 5-6 mins. Phone call : almost 1% reduction for every 4-5 mins. Which seems to be bit faster consumption. First iPhone I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôm not sure about regular battery consumption rate. But this doesn‚Äôt look nice to me.
iphone,Nikhil Sharma,4,Wonderful,Keep the battery aside and I don‚Äôt see any other reason why you shouldn‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs super fast: has an awesome pair of camera: punchy speaker: good looks: beautiful screen: perfect size and an amazing user experience. Everything about this phone is no nonsense.Coming to battery: I was aware it was less but I didn‚Äôt care because for my casual usage: it easily lasts 24hours. It easily gives an onscreen time of 4 hours per day and if you are using your phone for more than that: you know you...
iphone,Apurba Pan,5,Perfect product!,The powerful small phone that I always wished for !!Nowadays the fad is big screen phones but for me: I like a small powerful phone with awesome camera. Ticked all the boxes that I had in my mind. Switched from android. Never going back!

It is super fast‚úåÔ∏è.Overall it's the same iPhone 6 with an A13 chip and the generation updates a smartphone can get in 2020.No negative comments for the camera: apple is always the topper in capturing moments and SE2 has got the studio lights: a front facing portrait camera: a wider photo fr...

iphone,Neha Singh,5,Just wow!,I switched from iPhone 8 to iPhone SE instead of going for iPhone 11 since SE comes with same power and great camera with a device size I can easily use and hold in my single hand. I got this delivered within one day of being available in India and it‚Äôs just great. I am a big fan of iOS and I‚Äôm deep into the Apple ecosystem with my iPad: MacBook: AirPods and an old iPod and I‚Äôm not disappointed here too. To those of you who are wondering how is it different from iPhone 8 since it practically ...
iphone,Nithin Subhash,5,Best in this budget,This is an amazing phone for the price. For someone coming from a pure Android background: migrating data would take a little time: and the battery backup may be quite less for the first 1-2 days. Once it is all set: I felt that the phone gives a decent battery backup. The backup with the ~1800mAh battery on this phone is somewhat comparable to that of an Android with twice the capacity.Camera is amazing for my use: as the lighting and colour tone are Natural: close to what we would see with...

Prospective buyers can then decide1. For photo and video enthusiasts. Very reliable camera. Fast and excellent picture quality. Videos are absolutely stable and professional quality.

iphone,Raja Arora,5,A true mid-flagship disrupter has arrived.,If I could describe this device in a single work it'd be "Stellar": it's a bang for buck. Being an apple enthusiast from a long time I took a leap of faith with OnePlus 7: the device was indeed an 'Apple' in the android world: it was a no slouch phone and everything was top notch except the camera and some exclusive apps available on iOS only. My utmost priority to switch back to iPhone was camera and the apps available on the app store plus the unbreakable updates that Apple provides with ti...

If you have other apple products and you want to pair this up as your latest purchase.6. If you have a decent 42k to spend without any second thought.Why not to buy?1. Battery drain: and low battery capacity...
iphone,Dhanoop  Krishna,5,Brilliant,For ppl who prefer small displays this is the ryt choice neat n clean  top notch performance ......FOR THOSE WHO R CONCERNED ABOUT BATTERY This has 1821mAh battery but combined with a13 chip efficency is top notch . Use 10W charger which comes with ipad or buy separately within 45 mins phone charger from 0-80% The 5w included in box is waste good for nothing. Switch off optimised battery charging under battery health settings so 80-100% will b charged quickly.I use social media apps l...
